Establishing Communication Protocols is a crucial step in disaster recovery (DR) planning to ensure that during a disaster, accurate and timely information is communicated to all relevant stakeholders. Effective communication protocols help prevent confusion, streamline decision-making, and maintain trust both internally and externally. Below is a structured workflow for establishing communication protocols according to Susan Snedaker's approach.

### **Workflow: Establishing Communication Protocols**

#### **1. Identify Stakeholders and Communication Needs**
   - **Identify Internal Stakeholders**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team, department heads.
     - **What**: List all internal stakeholders who need to be informed during a disaster, including executives, IT staff, and employees.
     - **Why**: To ensure that everyone who plays a role in disaster recovery is kept informed.
   - **Identify External Stakeholders**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team, communications department.
     - **What**: List external stakeholders such as customers, vendors, partners, regulators, and the media who need to be communicated with during a disaster.
     - **Why**: To maintain trust and manage relationships with external parties.
   - **Determine Communication Needs**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team.
     - **What**: Assess the specific information each stakeholder group needs during a disaster (e.g., status updates, action plans, contact information).
     - **Why**: To tailor communication to meet the needs of each group effectively.

#### **2. Define Communication Channels**
   - **Select Appropriate Communication Channels for Internal Stakeholders**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team, IT staff.
     - **What**: Identify and select communication channels such as email, phone, instant messaging, and intranet for internal communications.

   - **Select Appropriate Communication Channels for External Stakeholders**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team, communications department.
     - **What**: Identify communication channels such as email, social media, press releases, and phone for external communications.
     - **Why**: To ensure clear and consistent communication with external parties.
   - **Establish Redundant Communication Methods**:
     - **Who**: IT staff, DR planning team.
     - **What**: Ensure backup communication methods are available in case primary channels fail (e.g., satellite phones, alternative email systems).
     - **Why**: To maintain communication even if the primary systems are compromised.

#### **3. Develop Communication Protocols**
   - **Create Internal Communication Protocols**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team.
     - **What**: Define protocols for how information will be shared internally, including who communicates with whom, how often, and what information should be included.
     - **Why**: To ensure consistent and efficient internal communication during a disaster.
   - **Create External Communication Protocols**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team, communications department.
     - **What**: Define protocols for communicating with external stakeholders, including who is responsible for external communications, the approval process, and the frequency of updates.
     - **Why**: To manage the organization’s public image and ensure accurate information is shared externally.
   - **Develop Crisis Communication Templates**:
     - **Who**: Communications department, DR planning team.
     - **What**: Prepare templates for common communication scenarios, such as data breaches, service outages, and natural disasters.
     - **Why**: To streamline the communication process and ensure consistency in messaging.

#### **4. Establish Escalation Procedures**
   - **Define Escalation Triggers**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team.
     - **What**: Identify specific events or thresholds that trigger the escalation of communication to higher management or external authorities.
     - **Why**: To ensure critical issues are promptly addressed by the appropriate personnel.
   - **Outline Escalation Paths**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team.
     - **What**: Document the chain of command for escalating issues, including who should be notified at each level and the methods to be used.
     - **Why**: To ensure that communication flows efficiently during escalating situations.
   - **Incorporate Legal and Compliance Requirements**:
     - **Who**: Legal department, DR planning team.
     - **What**: Ensure that escalation procedures comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including notification obligations.
     - **Why**: To avoid legal repercussions and ensure that all necessary parties are informed.

#### **5. Test and Validate Communication Protocols**
   - **Conduct Communication Drills**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team, all stakeholders.
     - **What**: Test the communication protocols through regular drills, simulating various disaster scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the communication plan.
     - **Why**: To identify weaknesses in the communication protocols and make necessary adjustments.
   - **Gather Feedback from Participants**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team.
     - **What**: Collect feedback from participants after drills to understand any challenges faced during the communication process.
     - **Why**: To improve communication protocols based on real-world feedback.
   - **Update Communication Protocols Based on Test Results**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team.
     - **What**: Revise communication protocols to address any issues identified during drills or actual incidents.
     - **Why**: To ensure protocols are effective and up to date.

#### **6. Document Communication Protocols**
   - **Create a Communication Protocol Document**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team, communications department.
     - **What**: Compile all communication protocols, including contact lists, escalation procedures, and templates, into a formal document.
     - **Why**: To provide a clear and accessible reference during a disaster.
   - **Include Contact Lists and Escalation Charts**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team.
     - **What**: Maintain up-to-date contact information for all stakeholders and include escalation charts in the document.
     - **Why**: To ensure that the correct people are contacted quickly during an incident.
   - **Distribute Communication Protocols to Stakeholders**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team leader.
     - **What**: Ensure that all relevant stakeholders receive and understand the communication protocols.
     - **Why**: To ensure everyone knows their roles and responsibilities during a disaster.

#### **7. Train and Educate Stakeholders**
   - **Conduct Training Sessions on Communication Protocols**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team, communications department.
     - **What**: Provide training to all stakeholders on the communication protocols, including how to use the communication tools and follow the established procedures.

   - **Develop Quick Reference Guides**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team.
     - **What**: Create quick reference guides or cheat sheets that summarize key communication procedures and contact information.
     - **Why**: To provide easy access to critical information during an emergency.

#### **8. Regularly Review and Update Communication Protocols**
   - **Schedule Regular Reviews**:
     - **Who**: DR planning team.
     - **What**: Set a schedule for regularly reviewing the communication protocols to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

### **Visual Workflow**
- **Start**: Identify Stakeholders and Communication Needs
- **Branch 1**: Define Communication Channels
- **Branch 2**: Develop Communication Protocols → Develop Crisis Communication Templates
- **Branch 3**: Establish Escalation Procedures → Incorporate Legal and Compliance Requirements
- **Test**: Conduct Communication Drills → Gather Feedback → Update Protocols
- **Document**: Create Communication Protocol Document → Include Contact Lists and Escalation Charts → Distribute to Stakeholders
- **Train**: Conduct Training Sessions → Develop Quick Reference Guides
- **Review**: Regularly Review and Update Protocols → Incorporate Lessons Learned
- **End**: Communication protocols established, trained, documented, and regularly updated

This workflow ensures that the communication protocols are comprehensive, actionable, and continuously improved, enabling effective communication during any disaster situation.
